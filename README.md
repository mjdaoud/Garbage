# Garbage
As a tourist/foreigner, one of the first things you notice in NYC is the garbage: piles of trash left in the streets that look ugly, smell ugly in the summer, and attract rodents. Yet New Yorkers don't seem bothered, and don't really care. I want to understand how big (or small) of a problem it is. And make them care about it.
